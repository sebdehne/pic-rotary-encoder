Rotary encoder test
===============

Assembly code which shows how to implement input signal of a rotary encoder. Change events are handled in an interrupt routine and the result can be picked up by the main program loop.

The encoder in this demo project manipulates a simple counter (back and forth) which is display using an LCD display.
